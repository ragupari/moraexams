# Mora Exams: Landing Website

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

Bun is the recommended package manager (instead of npm) and runtime (instead of node). However, **You can use node and npm if you want**.

The reason for recommending bun: it's faster. To install bun: [visit bun.sh](https://bun.sh).

### Commands

If you are using npm, replace `bun` with `npm` in the below commands.

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

### Deployment

Whenever a commit is pushed or a PR is merged to the main branch, the website will be automatically published on [moraexams.org](https://moraexams.org) in a few minutes. The site is hosted on Netlify.

<!-- ## ðŸš€ Project Structure -->

<!-- Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Any static assets, like images, are placed inside the `public/` directory. -->

### Todo

- Project Sturcuture in readme needs a rewrite
- better integration of i18n
- optimal use of hydration and ssr
- reduce unnecessay complexity in components and pages
- move exam centers and relevant data to database (makes it possible to change landing page contents from dashboard)
- make it deployable on docker
